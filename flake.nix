        # three keys and no more. The jar is therefore pinned by URL and hash, as its
        # consumer pins it, so both build the same Flix version from the same jar. Not from
        # the same store path: each flake wraps the jar in its own nixpkgs' JDK, and the two
        # lock different nixpkgs, so the paths differ while the compiler does not.
